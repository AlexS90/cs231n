# cs231n course homework repository

This repo contains my code for [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course.

All the code is structured in `_cs231` folder, including:
* `neural_nets` - Neural networks implementation:
- `layers.py` - low-level components, like separate levels;
- `models.py` - higher level components and specific helper functions;
* `gradient_checks.py` - routines for checkig correctness of backpropagation;
* `metrics.py` - routines for calculating metrics;
* `torch_utils.py` - scripts for PyTorch;

Jupyter notebooks are used for aggregating these together for each assignment.

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress.
